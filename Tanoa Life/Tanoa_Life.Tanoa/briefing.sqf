Main Server Rules<br/>
It is each players responsible for reading the server rules, Saying 'I cant find the server rules' is no excuse for not following the rules.<br/>
Server rules are on the server and in the forums.<br/>
When you join the server it is expected that you already know these rules or have an understanding of the server rules.<br/>
Lobby Sitting/Away From Keyboard [AFK]<br/>
You are not allowed to sit in the lobby and idle around, you will be kicked from the server as you may be taking a slot from somebody else.<br/>

Hacking/Cheating/Exploiting
Hacking the server or cheating on the server or using Game/Server exploits and duping items/money.<br/>
Abusing bugs or game mechanics for your own gain, will be an instant ban. Example: Binocular Glitching. This is abusing in game mechanics to benefit yourself or another party.<br/>
If you see anyone abusing these bugs, game mechanics or hacking on the server feel free to inform an admin or moderator. If there is no staff available, please record the name of the person and put a report up on the forums along with evidence.<br/>

Combat Logging/Fail Role Play/ Combat Storing<br/>
Combat Logging/Killing yourself to get out of roleplay is considered breaking of the rules. Attempting to log off, disconnecting your internet or close the game while in the middle of a roleplay situation is considered combat logging. Excuses will NOT be tolerated E.g. ?my internet cut out?. This is the same for storing a vehicle also known as combat storing.<br/>
If this does happen and it is by accident, you must return to the roleplay location and continue with the roleplay situation or contact an Admin ASAP on teamspeak and they will get you back into the roleplay situation. <br/>
Do not roleplay any sexual violence or rape on any of our servers the punishment for such an action is extremely severe.<br/>

Harassment<br/>
Harassment covers a wide range of behaviours that are of an offensive nature. It is commonly understood as behaviour which disturbs or upsets, and is characteristically repetitive.<br/>
Please realise serious abusive attitudes towards other will not be allowed, nor will any constant fighting. This includes threatening or disturbing behaviours.<br/>
Disrupting our game server with stupid, immature behaviour is not permitted. Anything racist will not be acceptable, nor racist names on all our servers, this also includes terrorist claims or unacceptable origins, this also applies to Homophobic attacks.Any roleplay of sexual violence etc will result in serious punishment being dealt upon you. This includes but is not limited to behaviours such as rape and sexual assault.<br/>

Meta-gaming<br/>
Meta-gaming is a broad term usually used to define any strategy, actions or method used in a game which transcends a prescribed rule-set or uses external factors to affect the game, or goes beyond the supposed limits or environment set by the game.<br/>
We do not tolerate stream-sniping in any form. Anyone caught using streams as a source of knowledge either in or out of game RP will receive a hefty ban.<br/>

Ignoring the Administrators or Moderators<br/>
Not following instructions set out by the server admins or moderators. If you go to one staff member don?t go to multiple about the same issue in hopes of getting a different answer. Only admins and moderators can move you over to other staff members, if you breach this rule you may be banned and/or removed from multiple servers. Always follow the chain of command.<br/>
Admins and/or Moderators decisions are judged case by case in all situations, this is to make it fair on both parties.<br/>
Opinions are always taken during a situation, but arguments are not. Admins and Moderators have the final say.<br/>
Remember: evidence will most likely be required in many situations you wish to bring up to a staff member. Screenshots will not often be sufficient for cases such as rdm, where video is the best option. <br/>

General Server Rules<br/><br/>

Vehicle DeathMatch (VDM)<br/>
Vehicle deathmatching is intentionally using the vdm script in an attempt to get an advantage over another player during a roleplay situation. E.g. ?I ran this person over because i wanted to knock him down so i could get a shot on him because he had a gun?.<br/>

Random DeathMatch (RDM)<br/>
Random deathmatching is killing a player without a roleplay reason or cause. The only way that you have the ability to kill someone is through declaration, this must be a valid declaration that is 30 seconds prior to shooting.<br/>
Shooting a player without giving reasonable time, up to 30 seconds can be considered RDM, this is unless they give a response to the declaration. E.g. You declare on a Huron landing at a drug dealer, after about 10 seconds it starts to take off, you have the right to shoot at that Huron as it has responded to your declaration by attempting to leave the area.<br/>
Guerrillas are not Terrorists any terrorist acts will be considered RDMing, saying 'allahu akbar' and shooting a large amount of people or blowing up an area cause people to die is extremely offensive to some people and you will receive a ban.<br/>
Military and Guerrilla are permanently at a state of war, RDM does not apply outside of safe zones.<br/>

New Life Rule (NLR)<br/>
If you are killed during a roleplay situation and respawn you are in new life rule. This means that you have no recollection of anything that just happened in your past life, you don?t remember who shot you, you don?t remember where you died. You cannot re-enter the site at which you died for 5 minutes and you must be a minimum of 500 m away from the area for those 5 minutes.<br/>
If you respawn or relog to get out of a roleplay situation it is not a new life. This is a bannable offense and you can receive a minimum of a 24 hour ban.<br/>
Any players that have been revived by a medic must go with them to the hospital to continue role-playing and can?t reengage in the activities that caused the revive (Accidentally Killed, Glitch Death, VDM, RDM all apply to this rule).<br/>
If you are involved in a situation where RDM HAS happened then come and talk to one of the Moderators or the Administrators and they will tell you whether or not you can re-enter the area where you died. The best way to contact a member of Tanoa Life staff is by joining the ?Tanoa Life issues? channel on the teamspeak. Remember to bring evidence in the form of video and in SOME cases screenshots.<br/>

Valued Life Rule (VLR)<br/>
Valued Life Rules states that you must value your life, if you are in a roleplay situation where you have a gun pointed to the back of your head you must comply to the person that has the gun to your head, a.k.a valuing your life. Valued Life Rules States ?basic human need to survive will govern actions by player, not a desire to cause problems, or accumulate items/money in game?. An easy way to figure out if you are breaking this rule is to think ?if in real life someone was pointing a gun at me, and there is no way i could ?grab the gun?, what would I do?<br/>

Kill On Sight (KOS)<br/>
The only KOS zones on the map are located on the Guerrilla Controlled Islands, the red meshed areas, All KOS zones, there is no need to declare intentions in these places, but you MUST be inside these areas.<br/>
Due to the war on tanoa between the Guerrillas and Military on Tanoa the interaction between the two different sides has become kill on site, e.g. if you?re rolling down the road as Guerrillas and you see military personnel you can get out and shoot them without a declaration. (ONLY Guerrillas)<br/>

Safezone<br/>
All areas marked in green are safe zones this includes all markets, garages, spawn points, ATMs, Hospitals, Military Base Island and Georgetown Office?s and Guerilla Outposts. You can not declare, Rob, steal vehicles or commit any acts of harm (knockdown, kidney theft, running over with vehicles) or any other type of hostile roleplay on players inside safe zones.<br/>
Anyone shooting into or harming any player in a safe zone will be removed from the server. If you are engaging with a player that has fled into a safe zone and kill an innocent, it WILL be classed as RDM. Examine the map before engaging or declaring with anyone as it might be a safe zone that you are declaring in.<br/>
You can not declare, enter without permission, or shoot at Military in their safe zones. If you Fail roleplay and kill Military during processing in any Military safe zone you will be removed from the server.<br/>
While in safezones the Military and Guerrillas can not do any hostile acts of any kind between each other.<br/>
When warring factions are leaving safezones they must wait till the other faction leaves or the factions leave in different directions from the safezone.<br/>
Military can ?Police? the civilians in the safezones, any Guerrullas found in a safezone will be detained.<br/>
Armed vehicles are not allowed to be used in safe zones, you must be at least 500m away from safe zones to use armed vehicles to attack or defence.<br/>

Communication<br/>
Only channels used to broadcast voice is through Direct, Group and Vehicle Chats. Side Chat and global chat are for text only, no voice is permitted. All Military and Guerrilla must be on teamspeak server in the channels required for these roles. Using voice changers, soundboards and music in game will cause you to be kicked and/or banned from the server.<br/>
All Military and Medics must be on teamspeak server in the channels required for these roles.<br/>
Civilians and Guerrillas have Teamspeak channels provided for them, Clan channels can be setup but you must talk to the Server Admin or Arma Coordinators.<br/>
Spamming in any Teamspeak or playing music in any channels other than music channels will result in you being kicked or banned from the server. <br/><br/>
